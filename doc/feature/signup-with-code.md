lets change our authentication method. I want the authentication flow to be as this: Upon sign up, the web page should prompt the user to fill in a 6-digit code that Supabase will generate and send to the email. The user should receive a message saying to open their email inbox and input this 6-digit code into the sign up page. Upon succesful verification the should be able to gain acces to their profile page and start using the app.
